  # resource is singular rather than resources

  # and it will have a ":id" wildcard. The controller
  # name must still be plural.

  resources :answers

  # `resources` method will generate all CRUD routes following
  # RESTful conventions for a resource. It will assume there is a 
  # controller named after the first argument pluralized and PascalCased.
  # (i.e. :question => QuestionsController)

  resources :questions do

    # Routes written inside of a block passed
    # to a `resources` method will be pre-fixed
    # by a path corresponding to the passed in symbol.
    # In this case, all nested routes will be
    # prefixed with `/questions/:question_id/`
    resources :answers, only: [:create, :destroy]

    # We could also add :index instead of get :liked, on: :collection we added below
    resources :likes, shallow: true, only: [:create, :destroy]
    # The shallow: true named argument will separate routes
    # that require the parent from those that don't.
    # Routes that require the parent won't change
    # (i.g. index, new, create)
    # Routes that don't require the parent
    # (e.g. show, efit, update, destroy) will have the
    # parent prefix (i.e. /question/:question_id) removed.

    # Example
    # /questions/10/likes/9/edit becomes /likes/9/edit

    get :liked, on: :collection
    # /questions/liked
    # Use the "on" named argument to specity how a
    # nested route behaves relative to its parent

    # `on: :collection` means that it acts on the 
    # entire resource. All questions in this case. `new`
    # and `create` act on the collection

    # get :also_liked, on: :member
    # `on: :member` means that it acts on a single resource.
    # A single question, in this case. `edit`, 
    # `update`, `destroy`, `show` are all member routes

  # To create, use methods named after HTTP
  # verbs. This includes: get, post, put, patch, delete, etc.

  # As a first argument, write a URL path as a string.
  # (e.g. "/", "/hello_world", "/posts/:id", etc)

  # Then, provide the named argument "to" with string that
  # describes the controller method that will be used to create
  # response to the client's request.

  # Example: 
  # `to: "welcome#index"` directs the request to
  # the `WelcomeController`'s index public method
  # `to: "posts#show"` direct the request to a
  # "PostsController"'s `show` method.

  get("/", to: "welcome#index", as: :root)
  # Routes in rails define methods named after
  # the route's path or the value given to the
  # 'as' argument.

  # root_path # => "/"
  # root_url # => "http://localhost:3000/"

  # To list all of your routes, use the command:
  # rails routes

  # The option defaults: {format: json} will se json
  # as a the default response for all routes.
  # The namespace method in Rails makes it so it will
  # automcatically look in a directory `api`, then
  # in a subdirectory v1
  namespace :api, defaults: {format: :json} do

    # The "*" prefix in the routes path allows this route wildcard
    # match ANYTHING.
  
    # The "via:" argument is required and is used to specify
    # which methods this route applies to.
    # Example: 
    # `via: [:get, :post, :patch]`
    # `via: :all` will match all mpossible methods.
