    # The `dependent` option specifies what happens to records
    # that are dependent on this one (i.e. a question has many answers).
    
    # Passing the `:destroy` tells ActiveRecord to delete the dependents
    # before deleting the owner record. In this case, delete
    # the answers before deleting the question.

    # Passing the value `:nullify` will set the dependent's foreign
    # key column (e.g. question_id) to null allowing the owning record
    # to be destroyed.
    has_many(:answers, dependent: :destroy)

    # `has_many(:answers)` adds the folliwing instance methods
    # to the Question model:

    # answers
    # answers<<(object, ...)
    # answers.delete(object, ...)
    # answers.destroy(object, ...)
    # answers=(objects)
    # answer_ids
    # answer_ids=(ids)
    # answers.clear
    # answers.empty?
    # answers.size
    # answers.find(...)
    # answers.where(...)
    # answers.exists?(...)
    # answers.build(attributes = {}, ...)
    # answers.create(attributes = {})
    # answers.create!(attributes = {})
    # answers.reload
        
    # Association instance methods can be used as part of
    # an Active Record query chain. For example:
    # q.answers.where("id > ?", 10).order(body: :desc).first
    
    # The is Question model for the questions table
    # Raols will attr_accessors for all columns of
    # the table (e.g. id, title, view_count, created_at, updated_at)

    # Create validations by using the `validates` method.
    # The arguments are (in order):
    # - A column name as a symbbol 
    # - Named arguments corresponding to valication riles

    # To read more on validations, go to the following guide:
    # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html
    validates(
        :title, 
        presence: true,
        uniqueness: true
    )

    validates(
        :body, 
        presence: {
            message: "must exist"
        },
        length: { minimum: 10 }
    )

    validates(
        :view_count, 
        numericality: {
            greater_than_or_equal_to: 0 # >=
            # lesser_than:
            # greater_than:
        }
    )


    
    # When writing a validation, you can assign a hash to
    # the validation rule and use that hash to configure
    # its different properties. In the example above, we replace
    # the usual message with our own when the presence validation
    # fails.

    # The `presence` refuses any record with the validated column
    # is nil or empty.

    # When a validation fails, ActiveRecord will not save
    # the model instance or changes to the databse.
    # View the validation errors using the methods on
    # .errors method.

    # To list error messages as a hash:
    # q.errors.messages

    # To list them in human friendly manner:
    # q.errors.full_message

    # Use the `valid?` method on a model instance to
    # test all validations. It'll return if the validations
    # success and false otherwise.

    # Custom Validation
    # Be careful, the method for custom validations is
    # singular and its almost exactly same the method
    # for regular validations.
