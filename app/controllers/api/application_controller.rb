    # When making POST, DELETE, PATCH requests to our controllers
    # Rails requires that authenticity token is included as part
    # of the params.
    # Normally Rails will add this to any form that we generate.
    # i.e. form helper methods such as form_with, form_tag, form_for etc.
  
    # This prevents third parties from making such requests to our Rails
    # application. It's a security measure that is unneccessary for a Web
    # API.

    # The priority for "rescue_from" is in the reverse order of
    # where the calls are made meaning that more specific errors
    # should be rescued last and general errors should rescued first.

    # The "StandardError" class is an ancestor of all errors that
    # programmer could cause in their program. Rescuing from it
    # will prevent nearly all errors from crashing our program.
    # Use this very carefully and make sure to always log the error
    # message is some form.
